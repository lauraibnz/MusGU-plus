  affiliation: Udio
  architecture: ''
  applications: continuation, editing, full-song generation, remixing, text-to-music

adaptability:
  hardware_requirements:
    value: low
    notes: 'No information is available about the hardware requirements to train the
      model. '
  dataset_size:
    value: low
    notes: 'No information is available about the amount or type of data required
      to adapt the model to a musician’s own music. '
  adaptation_pathways:
    value: low
    notes: No training, fine-tuning, or adaptation pathways are provided for users
      (e.g., no code, checkpoints, or interfaces), making adaptation infeasible from
      a musician’s perspective.
    tags: ''
  technical_barriers:
    value: low
    notes: Technical barriers for adaptation cannot be evaluated, as no adaptation
      mechanisms are provided or documented.
    tags: ''
  model_redistribution:
    value: low
    notes: Model weights and checkpoints are not accessible to users. The system is
      provided solely as a hosted service, and redistribution or sharing of adapted
      models is not permitted under the platform’s terms.
controllability:
  conditioning_inputs:
    value: partial
    notes: Udio relies on text-based conditioning, including free-form prompts and
      lyrics. It allows to set stylistic reference to set the overall mood and energy
      of the track.
    tags: lyrics, style tags, text
  time_varying_control:
    value: low
    notes: Udio provides limited time-localized control through iterative generation
      and segment-based continuation. However, it does not support explicit or fine-grained
      temporal conditioning such as per-frame, per-beat, or symbolic time-aligned
      controls. As a result, the generation itself cannot be guided by meaningful
      temporal controls.
  feature_disentanglement:
    value: low
    notes: No disentangled or explicitly separable musical control dimensions are
      exposed. Attributes such as timbre, harmony, rhythm, and form are implicitly
      entangled within prompt-based generation.
    tags: ''
  control_parameters:
    value: low
    notes: Udio does not provide any control parameters beyond the conditioning inputs.
    tags: ''
usability:
  interface_availability:
    value: high
    notes: 'A dedicated consumer-facing interface is provided for music generation
      through a web-based application, requiring no local installation or technical
      setup. An iOS app is also available. '
    tags: iOS app, web UI
  access_restrictions:
    value: partial
    notes: Access requires using user accounts, accepting terms and conditions and
      is subject to usage constraints, such as quotas and plan-dependent features,
      which may limit continuous or unrestricted use. Free trials and promotional
      codes are available.
  realtime_capabilities:
    value: partial
    notes: Generation takes several seconds and is not designed for live or audio-rate
      real-time interaction. The system supports real-time editing but not real-time
      performance or streaming control.
  workflow_integration:
    value: low
    notes: The system operates as a standalone platform. There is no supported mechanism
      for integrating the model into DAWs, live music environments, or other existing
      music workflows.
    tags: ''
  output_licensing:
    value: low
    notes: 'The model’s outputs are subject to proprietary licensing: use is restricted
      to personal, non-commercial purposes, downloading outputs is prohibited, and
      ownership of generated content is retained by the company, which constitutes
      a heavy restriction to output usage. Attribution is required for public use
      of outputs, although this requirement may be waived for outputs generated under
      a paid subscription.'
  community_support:
    value: high
    notes: User-facing support resources are available via a help center and  chatbox
      in their website, and a community in discord Discord and a forum in Reddit,
      where musicians and music-lovers are encourage to share tips and support.
