project:
  name: RAVE
  affiliation: IRCAM
  architecture: variational autoencoder
  applications: audio synthesis, style transfer
  link: ''
  notes: ''
adaptability:
  hardware_requirements:
    value: partial
    notes: A consumer-grade GPU (e.g., 8–16GB VRAM) is needed depending on configuration.
      Lightweight options (e.g., ONNX, Raspberry) reduce demands, but CPU-only training
      is not recommended.
  dataset_size:
    value: high
    notes: The model is designed to be trained on relatively small, domain-specific
      datasets, with documentation suggesting a few hours of homogeneous audio as
      a practical minimum, making personal datasets viable.
  adaptation_pathways:
    value: high
    notes: Complete dataset preparation, training, export, and prior training pipelines
      are provided, with multiple architectures and configurations explicitly intended
      for adaptation on new data.
    tags: prior training, training
  technical_barriers:
    value: partial
    notes: Training and preprocessing rely on command-line tools and Python environments.
      A Colab notebook, a detailed tutorial, and extensive documentation are provided,
      making adaptation accessible to users with basic technical skills, but no dedicated
      training GUI is available.
    tags: CLI, Colab, tutorial
  model_redistribution:
    value: partial
    notes: RAVE’s CC BY-NC 4.0 license permits redistribution of trained models or
      checkpoints with attribution for non-commercial use. Sharing is legally allowed
      but commercially restricted and not explicitly structured or encouraged beyond
      general community practice.
controllability:
  conditioning_inputs:
    value: partial
    notes: RAVE primarily operates in an audio-to-audio paradigm. Conditioning is
      based on incoming audio, with no native support for text, MIDI, or symbolic
      inputs.
    tags: audio
  time_varying_control:
    value: partial
    notes: RAVE preserves temporal structure through audio-to-audio conditioning,
      with output following the time evolution of the input signal. However, it does
      not support explicit symbolic or structured time-varying controls (e.g. MIDI,
      aligned control envelopes, or temporal embeddings).
  feature_disentanglement:
    value: partial
    notes: Post-training analysis identifies informative latent dimensions and improves
      controllability, but these dimensions are not associated with explicit or interpretable
      musical attributes, such as pitch or timbre.
    tags: ''
  control_parameters:
    value: high
    notes: RAVE exposes a rich set of inference-time control parameters, including
      per-dimension latent scaling and bias, controllable noise injection, and optional
      latent priors, enabling fine-grained manipulation during synthesis.
    tags: latent manipulation, latent noise, latent prior
usability:
  interface_availability:
    value: high
    notes: Inference is available via multiple user-facing interfaces, including a
      VST plugin and real-time integrations for Max/MSP and Pure Data, in addition
      to command-line tools.
    tags: AU, Max/MSP, PureData, VST
  access_restrictions:
    value: high
    notes: The model’s source code is publicly available, along with inference scripts
      and pretrained models. No login, subscription, or usage limits apply.
  realtime_capabilities:
    value: high
    notes: The model supports low-latency, real-time audio synthesis and streaming,
      including CPU-based real-time inference suitable for live performance.
  workflow_integration:
    value: high
    notes: RAVE can be embedded directly into common music workflows, including DAWs
      and visual programming environments, enabling both studio and live use.
    tags: DAW, visual programming
  output_licensing:
    value: partial
    notes: The output may be used, modified, and shared for non-commercial purposes
      only, and attribution is required. Commercial use of generated material is not
      permitted under CC BY-NC 4.0.
  community_support:
    value: high
    notes: Active and accessible support is available via a dedicated Discord server,
      GitHub discussions, and regularly updated tutorials and examples.
    tags: Discord, Forum, GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues
