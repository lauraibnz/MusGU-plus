project:
  name: Neutone Morpho
  affiliation: Neutone Inc.
  architecture: autoencoder
  applications: audio synthesis, style transfer

adaptability:
  hardware_requirements:
    value: high
    notes: Custom model training does not require local compute resources. Morpho’s
      training pipeline is fully cloud-based and handled by Neutone’s infrastructure,
      meaning end users do not need a GPU, local installation, or machine learning
      environment. Training completes within approximately a day.
  dataset_size:
    value: high
    notes: Morpho is designed to be trained on small, musician-scale datasets, with
      clear guidance suggesting ~45 minutes of unique audio as a practical target.
      This scale is well within reach of individual musicians working with personal
      recordings or sound libraries.
  adaptation_pathways:
    value: partial
    notes: A complete and practical adaptation pathway is provided through Neutone’s
      proprietary training service, allowing musicians to upload audio and train custom
      models end-to-end. However, the training process is closed-source and platform-bound,
      with no access to underlying training code, checkpoints, or local fine-tuning
      workflows.
    tags: training
  technical_barriers:
    value: high
    notes: 'Model adaptation is designed explicitly for non-technical users. Training
      is performed via a drag-and-drop, no-code interface, supported by extensive
      musician-oriented guidance on dataset preparation and workflow. Neutone provides
      step-by-step blog tutorials as well as a dedicated FAQ section detailing requirements
      and best practices, making the adaptation process accessible to users without
      programming or machine learning experience. '
    tags: GUI, drag-and-drop, tutorial
  model_redistribution:
    value: low
    notes: Models trained via Neutone Morpho are owned exclusively by the user who
      trained them and automatically become available for use within the Morpho plugin.
      However, there is no documented mechanism for exporting trained models, sharing
      them with other users, or deploying them outside the Neutone ecosystem. Redistribution
      is therefore effectively restricted to private, in-platform use.
controllability:
  conditioning_inputs:
    value: partial
    notes: Morpho conditions on incoming audio, using learned timbral representations
      to transform signals in real time. While rich in effect, conditioning is limited
      to a single musically meaningful modality rather than multiple symbolic or structured
      inputs.
    tags: audio
  time_varying_control:
    value: partial
    notes: Time-localized control emerges implicitly through real-time resynthesis,
      as the output dynamically follows the temporal structure of the input signal.
      However, the model does not expose explicit time-indexed representations or
      independent control over temporal musical attributes (e.g., pitch curves or
      structural markers).
  feature_disentanglement:
    value: partial
    notes: Neutone Morpho exhibits partial feature disentanglement through its latent
      audio representation, which is trained to encode a small number of perceptually
      salient characteristics of the training data. Some latent variables may show
      consistent correlations with perceptual attributes (e.g., pitch or texture),
      and these relationships are partially exposed through macro controls. However,
      these dimensions are not explicitly modeled as independent musical features,
      remain unlabeled and model-dependent, and do not provide robust, interpretable
      control over musical attributes.
    tags: ''
  control_parameters:
    value: high
    notes: Neutone Morpho exposes a set of learned macro-controls that influence stochastic
      behavior and the strength of coupling between input and output, offering musically
      intuitive control over unpredictability and responsiveness. In addition, an
      experimental Micro View allows users to directly offset and scale individual
      latent variables in real time, enabling fine-grained manipulation of the model’s
      internal representation.
    tags: conditioning strength, latent manipulation, randomness
usability:
  interface_availability:
    value: high
    notes: Neutone Morpho is distributed as a polished VST3/AU plugin with a dedicated
      graphical interface, designed for immediate use inside major DAWs. No scripting,
      external inference setup, or technical configuration is required.
    tags: AU, VST
  access_restrictions:
    value: partial
    notes: The plugin itself is freely downloadable with a limited set of bundled
      models and a time-limited trial of the full library. Access to additional pretrained
      models and custom model training requires account creation and paid purchases,
      introducing moderate platform-level restrictions.
  realtime_capabilities:
    value: high
    notes: Morpho is explicitly designed for real-time audio processing, operating
      with low and predictable latency suitable for live performance. The system is
      optimized for consumer CPUs (e.g., Apple M1-class hardware) and is demonstrated
      in both DAW and embedded hardware contexts.
  workflow_integration:
    value: high
    notes: Morpho integrates directly into standard music production workflows as
      an audio effect and instrument plugin, with automation-ready parameters and
      compatibility with all major DAWs. Ongoing work (e.g., Project LYDIA with Roland)
      further demonstrates its suitability for hardware and live performance contexts.
    tags: DAW, hardware
  output_licensing:
    value: high
    notes: Audio output generated using Neutone Morpho is fully usable for personal
      and commercial purposes, and users retain ownership of the sounds they create.
      According to Neutone’s published policy on AI and copyright, the base models
      are trained exclusively on open-source or appropriately licensed audio (e.g.,
      public domain, Creative Commons, or audio used with the consent of artists),
      with all training data cited, reflecting a commitment to legal and ethical use
      of copyrighted material.
  community_support:
    value: high
    notes: Neutone maintains an active Discord community, direct support channels,
      detailed blog posts, FAQs, and ongoing artist-focused communication, providing
      accessible support for both creative and technical questions.
