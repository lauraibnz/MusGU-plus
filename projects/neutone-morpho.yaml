project:

  affiliation: Neutone Inc.

  applications: audio synthesis, style transfer

adaptability:
  hardware_requirements:
    value: high
    notes: Custom model training does not require local compute resources. Morpho’s
      training pipeline is fully cloud-based, requiring no GPU, no local installation,
      and no ML environment, which removes hardware barriers entirely for end users.
  dataset_size:
    value: high
    notes: Morpho is designed to be trained on small, musician-scale datasets, with
      clear guidance suggesting ~45 minutes of unique audio as a practical target.
      This scale is well within reach of individual musicians working with personal
      recordings or sound libraries.
  adaptation_pathways:
    value: partial
    notes: A complete and practical adaptation pathway is provided through Neutone’s
      proprietary training service, allowing musicians to upload audio and train custom
      models end-to-end. However, the training process is closed-source and platform-bound,
      with no access to underlying training code, checkpoints, or local fine-tuning
      workflows.
    tags: training
  technical_barriers:
    value: high
    notes: Model adaptation is designed explicitly for non-technical users. Training
      is performed via a drag-and-drop, no-code interface, with extensive musician-oriented
      guidance on dataset preparation, making the process accessible to users without
      programming or machine learning experience.
    tags: GUI, drag-and-drop
  model_redistribution:
    value: partial
    notes: Trained models can be freely used by their creators within the Neutone
      ecosystem, but redistribution is constrained to the platform. Models cannot
      be exported or reused outside Neutone’s plugin environment, limiting portability
      despite creative freedom within the system.
controllability:
  conditioning_inputs:
    value: partial
    notes: Morpho conditions on incoming audio, using learned timbral representations
      to transform signals in real time. While rich in effect, conditioning is limited
      to a single musically meaningful modality rather than multiple symbolic or structured
      inputs.
    tags: audio
  time_varying_control:
    value: partial
    notes: Time-localized control emerges implicitly through real-time resynthesis,
      as the output dynamically follows the temporal structure of the input signal.
      However, the model does not expose explicit time-indexed representations or
      independent control over temporal musical attributes (e.g., pitch curves or
      structural markers).
  feature_disentanglement:
    value: partial
    notes: Neutone Morpho exhibits partial feature disentanglement through real-time
      audio resynthesis, where temporal structure and pitch contours of the input
      signal are largely preserved while timbre is transformed by the selected model.
      This yields predictable and musically coherent behavior in practice, but control
      pathways are implicit and dependent on the trained model, with no explicit or
      independently manipulable representations of pitch, loudness, or structure.
    tags: ''
  control_parameters:
    value: partial
    notes: Neutone Morpho exposes a small set of learned macro-controls that influence
      stochastic behavior and the strength of coupling between input and output. These
      parameters offer musically intuitive control over unpredictability and responsiveness,
      but do not provide direct access to or manipulation of internal latent representations.
    tags: conditioning strength, randomness
usability:
  interface_availability:
    value: high
    notes: Neutone Morpho is distributed as a polished VST3/AU plugin with a dedicated
      graphical interface, designed for immediate use inside major DAWs. No scripting,
      external inference setup, or technical configuration is required.
    tags: AU, VST
  access_restrictions:
    value: partial
    notes: The plugin itself is freely downloadable with a limited set of bundled
      models and a time-limited trial of the full library. Access to additional pretrained
      models and custom model training requires account creation and paid purchases,
      introducing moderate platform-level restrictions.
  realtime_capabilities:
    value: high
    notes: Morpho is explicitly designed for real-time audio processing, operating
      with low and predictable latency suitable for live performance. The system is
      optimized for consumer CPUs (e.g., Apple M1-class hardware) and is demonstrated
      in both DAW and embedded hardware contexts.
  workflow_integration:
    value: high
    notes: Morpho integrates directly into standard music production workflows as
      an audio effect and instrument plugin, with automation-ready parameters and
      compatibility with all major DAWs. Ongoing work (e.g., Project LYDIA with Roland)
      further demonstrates its suitability for hardware and live performance contexts.
    tags: DAW, hardware
  output_licensing:
    value: high
    notes: Audio output generated using Neutone Morpho is fully usable for personal
      and commercial purposes. Models are trained exclusively on licensed or user-provided
      data, and users retain ownership of sounds they create.
  community_support:
    value: high
    notes: Neutone maintains an active Discord community, direct support channels,
      detailed blog posts, FAQs, and ongoing artist-focused communication, providing
      accessible support for both creative and technical questions.
