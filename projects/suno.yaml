adaptability:
  hardware_requirements:
    value: low
    notes: No information is provided regarding the hardware requirements for training
      the model.
  dataset_size:
    value: low
    notes: No information is provided about the amount or type of data required for
      training or fine-tuning the model.
  adaptation_pathways:
    value: low
    notes: No training or fine-tuning pathways are exposed to users (e.g., no code,
      checkpoints, or interfaces), making adaptation infeasible from a musician’s
      perspective.
    tags: ''
  technical_barriers:
    value: low
    notes: Technical barriers for adaptation cannot be evaluated, as no adaptation
      mechanisms are provided or documented.
    tags: ''
  model_redistribution:
    value: low
    notes: Model weights and checkpoints are not accessible to users. The system is
      provided solely as a hosted service, and redistribution or sharing of adapted
      models is not permitted under the platform’s terms.
controllability:
  conditioning_inputs:
    value: partial
    notes: Suno primarily relies on text-based conditioning, including free-form prompts
      and lyrics. It also allows reference-based reuse of stylistic characteristics
      from existing songs, enabling style guidance through audio examples without
      exposing explicit or interpretable conditioning representations.
    tags: audio, lyrics, style tags, text
  time_varying_control:
    value: low
    notes: Suno does not expose explicit time-varying control signals such as aligned
      envelopes, symbolic sequences, or structured temporal representations.
  feature_disentanglement:
    value: low
    notes: No disentangled or explicitly separable musical control dimensions are
      exposed. Attributes such as timbre, harmony, rhythm, and form are implicitly
      entangled within prompt-based generation.
    tags: ''
  control_parameters:
    value: partial
    notes: Suno exposes a small set of high-level inference-time controls, such as
      variability and conditioning strength for style or audio inputs, through its
      interface. No access to low-level model parameters or internal representations
      is provided.
    tags: conditioning strength, randomness
usability:
  interface_availability:
    value: high
    notes: A dedicated consumer-facing interface is provided for music generation
      through a web-based application, requiring no local installation or technical
      setup. Additional iOs and Android apps are available.
    tags: Android app, iOS app, web UI
  access_restrictions:
    value: partial
    notes: Access requires user accounts and is subject to usage constraints, such
      as quotas, plan-dependent features, or queue-based generation, which may limit
      continuous or unrestricted use.
  realtime_capabilities:
    value: partial
    notes: Generation occurs with noticeable latency and is not designed for live
      or audio-rate real-time interaction. The system supports interactive use but
      not real-time performance or streaming control.
  workflow_integration:
    value: low
    notes: The system operates as a standalone platform. Although generated audio
      can be exported, there is no supported mechanism for integrating the model into
      DAWs, live music environments, or other existing music workflows.
    tags: ''
  output_licensing:
    value: partial
    notes: Some use limitations apply to the generated output (e.g., free-tier outputs
      are non-commercial and require attribution; commercial use is tied to paid tiers;
      additional restrictions include prohibitions on competitive use and using output
      to train other ML models).
  community_support:
    value: high
    notes: User-facing support resources are available via a help center and a community
      Discord.
    tags: Discord, Help center
