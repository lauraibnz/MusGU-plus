    <p style="margin-top: 0;">
        The <strong>Music-Generative Usable+ AI (MusGU+)</strong> framework is a musician-centered evaluation framework designed to assess how generative music models can be adapted, used, and controlled in real-world creative contexts. 
        The framework evaluates models along three complementary dimensions, with each dimension addressing a key question from the musician's perspective:
      </p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Adaptability</strong> — <em>Can I realistically adapt this model to my own data?</em></li>
    <li><strong>Usability</strong> — <em>Can I access, run, and integrate this model into my music-making workflow?</em></li>
    <li><strong>Controllability</strong> — <em>Can I guide the model in musically meaningful and interpretable ways?</em></li>
    </ul>

<section id="criteria">
  <h2><strong>Adaptability</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Assesses how feasible it is for musicians to adapt a model to their own data, focusing on practical constraints and supported training or fine-tuning pathways.
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Hardware Requirements</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The model can be trained or fine-tuned on CPU-only systems within a practical timeframe for end users.</li>
    <li>Requires a consumer-grade GPU (e.g., T4, P100), such as those found in mid-range gaming laptops or common cloud GPU instances.</li>
    <li>Requires dedicated high-end GPUs (e.g., A100s, multi-GPU rigs) or TPUs. Cannot be adapted without access to premium or institutional-level hardware.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Dataset Size</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The model can be effectively trained or fine-tuned using small, personal datasets (e.g., minutes to a few hours of audio).</li>
    <li>The model requires a significant amount (e.g., tens of hours) of recordings or curated datasets, exceeding the size of most musicians' own libraries.</li>
    <li>The model requires large-scale datasets (e.g., hundreds of hours of diverse, high-quality material), making adaptation infeasible without access to institutional or commercial-scale data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Adaptation Pathways</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The model provides practical pathways for training and/or fine-tuning on a musician's own data, such as complete training code, data processing and fine-tuning scripts with required checkpoints, or a dedicated interface for this purpose.</li>
    <li>Adaptation pathways are partially available (e.g., incomplete training code, fine-tuning code without checkpoints), requiring users to assemble or infer missing elements.</li>
    <li>No practical adaptation pathways are provided. The model cannot be meaningfully trained or fine-tuned using the provided materials.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Technical Barriers</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A user-friendly graphical interface or dedicated app is provided for model adaptation, designed for musicians with no programming experience.</li>
    <li>The model provides a streamlined setup (e.g., Colab notebook) for training or fine-tuning, with clear instructions and documentation, making it suitable for users with basic technical skills.</li>
    <li>Only raw code or scripts are provided, with minimal or no guidance or documentation. Training or fine-tuning requires significant programming knowledge and low-level configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Model Redistribution</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Redistribution of trained and/or fine-tuned models or checkpoints is explicitly permitted, allowing adapted models to be shared outside the original system.</li>
    <li>Adapted models or checkpoints can be redistributed, but only under constraints (e.g., non-commercial or research-only use, platform-bound sharing).</li>
    <li>Redistribution of adapted models or checkpoints is prohibited, contractually restricted, or technically impossible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Usability</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Examines how easily musicians can run, interact with, and integrate the model into their creative workflows, including access constraints and available support channels.
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Interface Availability</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A dedicated app or user-friendly graphical interface is provided for running the model (e.g., web platform, HuggingFace Space, standalone GUI, mobile app, Max4Live device), requiring minimal or no setup.</li>
    <li>A simplified interface (e.g., Max/MSP or Pure Data patch, Gradio UI code to be run locally) is available but requires some setup or domain-specific familiarity.</li>
    <li>Only raw code or scripts are provided for inference, requiring setup from scratch and significant technical knowledge.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Access Restrictions</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The model can be used freely and repeatedly without limits, paywalls, or subscriptions. This includes open-source tools with available inference code and pretrained checkpoints, or publicly accessible platforms with no login requirements or usage limits.</li>
    <li>Inference is possible, but access is constrained (e.g., login required, acceptance of terms of use, daily usage limits, or restricted free tiers), introducing account-based or usage limitations.</li>
    <li>Direct inference is not feasible due to missing components (e.g., no pretrained checkpoint or inference code), or access is fully restricted (e.g., paywalls, subscriptions, or unstable user interfaces).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Real-Time Capabilities</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The system generates output with minimal or imperceptible delay (e.g., milliseconds to a few seconds), making it suitable for live use even on modest hardware.</li>
    <li>Generation is possible with a moderate delay (e.g., several seconds), making it usable in interactive settings but not for live use. Real-time performance may require a consumer-grade GPU.</li>
    <li>Generation is slow (e.g., minutes per sample) or impractical for real-time use, especially on typical personal computers or laptops.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Workflow Integration</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The model is directly usable in common music workflows (e.g., within DAWs, visual programming environments, live coding systems, or dedicated music hardware).</li>
    <li>Some integration is possible (e.g., via OSC/MIDI connectivity or similar control-based interfaces).</li>
    <li>The system is isolated, with no clear path to embed it in existing creative setups or musical instruments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Output Licensing</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The output is fully usable for both personal and commercial purposes without restriction.</li>
    <li>Some use limitations apply to the generated output (e.g., non-commercial use only, attribution required, unclear terms).</li>
    <li>Output use is heavily restricted or prohibited (e.g., proprietary licensing, unclear or forbidding terms).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Community Support</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>An open, user-facing community space is available (e.g., Discord server or forum), suitable for musicians to ask questions and share workflows.</li>
    <li>Limited or developer-oriented channels are available (e.g., GitHub issues), which may provide assistance but are less accessible to most musicians.</li>
    <li>No meaningful public support or community spaces are provided.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Controllability</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Evaluates the kinds of input and internal control mechanisms a model offers to guide its behavior, including the diversity, structure, and independence of its control pathways.
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Conditioning Inputs</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The model accepts multiple and diverse conditioning inputs, including at least two musically meaningful modalities (e.g., audio, MIDI, symbolic), enabling rich and varied guidance during generation.</li>
    <li>Conditioning is limited to one musically meaningful modality, possibly combined with descriptive inputs (e.g., audio and text).</li>
    <li>Offers little to no input conditioning. Generation is mostly uncontrolled or limited to coarse or global labels (e.g., genre, tempo).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Time-Varying Control</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Supports precise time-varying control (e.g., per-frame pitch, loudness, or symbolic changes), enabling fine-grained structural and expressive manipulation.</li>
    <li>Some time-localized control is available (e.g., melody following or segment-based prompts), but not fine-grained.</li>
    <li>Only global control is possible, with no ability to influence generation over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Feature Disentanglement</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Provided controls are designed to influence distinct and isolated musical attributes (e.g., timbre, pitch, rhythm, structure), enabling predictable and interpretable guidance.</li>
    <li>Some effort is made to separate control pathways, but conditioning inputs are not explicitly associated with interpretable musical attributes, and interactions are expected.</li>
    <li>Control signals are entangled or loosely defined, making it unclear how specific inputs relate to individual musical attributes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Control Parameters</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Provides multiple configurable model parameters (e.g., duration, randomness, style strength) and enables direct manipulation of internal representations.</li>
    <li>Provides a limited set of configurable parameters and/or restricted access to latent representations.</li>
    <li>No additional meaningful parameters or internal controls are exposed beyond the primary conditioning mechanisms, if any.</li>
  </ul>
